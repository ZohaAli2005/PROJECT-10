# PROJECT-10

💼 Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a responsive Personal Portfolio Website built using HTML, CSS. It is designed to showcase personal information, skills, and completed projects in a clean and modern layout. The website includes a hero section with an introduction, a projects gallery, and a contact section with social media links.

The main purpose of this project is to create a professional online presence and practice front-end development concepts such as responsive design, layout structuring, and user interface styling. While working on this project, I improved my skills in creating multi-section websites, organizing project showcases, and building user-friendly navigation systems. This project serves as a portfolio template for developers and is intended for learning and personal branding purposes.
